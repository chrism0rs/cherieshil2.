    <h1>To the most perfect bf ever ❤️</h1>
    <p>
      Half a year, six whole months. 183 days, can you believe it? Half a year ago, my life changed in the quietest but most powerful way because you walked into it, and somehow, you made everything brighter without even trying.<br><br>

      You, with your gentle heart.<br>
      You, with your overwhelming love.<br>
      You, with all your imperfections and pain and still, the strength to love me so much.<br><br>

      I know life hasn’t been easy for you. I see the battles you fight inside your head, even when you try to hide them behind a smile or brush them off like they’re no big deal. But they are a big deal. You are a big deal. And the fact that you still show up for me, still give me love, still pour your energy into this relationship even when you feel like you’re barely holding yourself together, that’s the kind of love that’s rare. That’s the kind of love you give.<br><br>

      And honestly I don’t always deserve it.<br><br>

      There have been times where I’ve neglected your feelings. Times when I didn’t check in when I should have, when I said the wrong thing or didn’t say anything at all. Times when I was too wrapped up in my own thoughts and forgot that you needed love too. And for all of those moments, I’m so deeply sorry.<br><br>

      Because the truth is I care about you more than I know how to explain. I don’t always show it right. I get caught up. I get distracted. But in the quiet moments when I’m lying in bed thinking about you, or when I hear your voice and everything in me calms down I feel it. That you’re everything. That no one else could make me feel the way you do. NO MFING ELSE.<br><br>

      You’ve taught me so much about patience, about softness, about vulnerability. You’ve reminded me that being strong doesn’t mean hiding how you feel, and that love is something you fight for, even when it’s hard. Especially when it’s hard.<br><br>

      You’re not just my boyfriend. You’re my safe space. You’re my best friend. YOU ARE MY FREAKING HUSBAND. You’re the one I want to come home to, even if “home” is just a call, a cuddle, or a text.<br><br>

      I’m so proud of you. For trying. For surviving. For being kind when the world hasn’t always been kind to you. For still loving me through my flaws, my moods, and my messy personality. I know you doubt yourself sometimes, but let me be clear:<br><br>

      You are more than enough. I wish you knew how much you mean to me Nishil Krishna, I love you so f*cking much man, you are the MAN I need.<br><br>

      You are everything I didn’t even know I needed.<br>
      You are loved so, so deeply by me.<br><br>

      I myself am shocked to realise how I can love someone so much, that everyone are just stones and you are just a diamond shining between them. How can you be so handsome, cute and sexy? Your features are sculpted by god himself for me to worship. You are my GOD, Nishil Krishna.<br><br>

      So here’s to six months of us.<br>
      Six months of growing, learning, messing up, forgiving, laughing, and holding each other through it all. Six months of becoming something real and rare.<br><br>

      WE ARE MARRYING. I can’t wait to make you all mine legally. HAPPY half a year anniversary my beloved boy, my baby and my kiddo, my protector, my bf, my husband, my best friend, my everything.<br><br>

      Thank you for loving me the way you do. I love you more than words can ever hold.<br><br>

      Forever yours ♡<br>
      Your wifeyy aka ur chinnumari
